  ## Usage
  Here are the instructions and examples of how to use this project:
  You sign up using your email, first name, last name, create a password, confirm the password, select your draft position, and if you are the commissioner then you     enter the team names for all of the 12 teams in your league. After that the draftboard shows with a dropdown menu, you select the player from the dropdown menu that   you want to draft, then click the draftplayer button. The player will show in the next available pick on the draft board. The draftboard is set up as a snake draft     and the background color will change for the player depending on their position. Each individual team will have their team name, profile picture, and the players       that they have selected by round.
